Once upon a time, there were three friends who lived in a tiny hut near a lake.
<br>

They were fishermen by trade and the lake was bountiful with trout.
<br>

One day the tallest of the friends turned to the others and said:
<br>

</strong>

<strong>
Why dont we build three huts for each one of us?
 
Middle one applaud. Short one said;

-I heard this story about a wolf and piggies. I dont want to be the one building my hut from straw. Long one replied 

-Don't be dramatic we will check Koninklijk besluit van 7 juli 1994 tot vaststelling van de basisnormen voor de preventie van brand en ontploffing waaraan de gebouwen moeten voldoen (update 2016)

After some legal discussions the three agreed to contact a contractor who could make a fire-resistant hut so. 

The hut agreed to all laws and norms. Or so they thought. The day after they finished the hut a functionary  arrived.

- As by the stistofarrest of 20 februari 2020, your milieueffectenrapport is not sufficient an your hut needs be broken down.

That's when the environmentalists from the *Green party* stepped in. "No house should be destroyed" they said! Think about all the waste! So the three fishermen stayed in the same old hut...
