Once upon a time, there were three friends who lived in a tiny hut near a lake.
<br>

They were fishermen by trade and the lake was bountiful with trout.
<br>

One day the tallest of the friends turned to the others and said:

<strong>

Middle one applaud. Short one said;

-I heard this story about a wolf and piggies. I dont want to be the one building my hut from straw. Long one replied 

-Don't be dramatic we will check Koninklijk besluit van 7 juli 1994 tot vaststelling van de basisnormen voor de preventie van brand en ontploffing waaraan de gebouwen moeten voldoen (update 2016)
